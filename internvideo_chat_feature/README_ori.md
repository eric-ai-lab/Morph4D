# InternVideo2-Chat-8B

[\[üìÇ GitHub\]](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/InternVideo/tree/main/InternVideo2)   [\[üìú Tech Report\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15377) [\[üó®Ô∏è Chat Demo\]](https://vchat.opengvlab.com/)  

To further enrich the semantics embedded in **InternVideo2** and improve its user-friendly in human communications, we tune InternVideo2 by incorporating it into a VideoLLM with a LLM and a video BLIP. We employ the progressive learning scheme in [VideoChat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17005) by using InternVideo2 as the video encoder and train a video blip for
communicating with open-sourced LLM. In training, the video encoder will be updated. Detailed training recipts are in [VideoChat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17005).

The BaseLLM of this model is Mistral-7B.**Before using it, please ensure that you have obtained the access permission of Mistral-7B**, if not yet obtained, please go to[Mistral-7B](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3) to obtain the access permission and add your `HF_token` to the environment variable. 

## üìà Performance

## üöÄ How to use the model

1. Apply for the permission of this project and the base LLM permission 

2. Fill the HF user access token into the environment variable

```shell
export HF_TOKEN=hf_....
```
If you don't know how to obtain the token starting with "hf_", please refer to: [How to Get HF User access Token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens#user-access-tokens)

3. make sure to have `transformers >= 4.39.0, peft==0.5.0`

```
pip install transformers==4.39.1
pip install peft==0.5.0
pip install timm easydict einops
```

Install the requisite Python packages from [pip_requirements](https://huggingface.co/OpenGVLab/InternVideo2_chat_8B_HD/blob/main/requirements.txt)

# The video shows a woman performing yoga on a rooftop with a beautiful view of the mountains in the background. She starts by standing on her hands and knees, then moves into a downward dog position, and finally ends with a standing position. Throughout the video, she maintains a steady and fluid movement, focusing on her breath and alignment. The video is a great example of how yoga can be practiced in different environments and how it can be a great way to connect with nature and find inner peace.

response, chat_history = model.chat(tokenizer, '', 'What is she wearing?', media_type='video', media_tensor=video_tensor, chat_history= chat_history, return_history=True,generation_config={'do_sample':False})
# The woman in the video is wearing a black tank top and grey yoga pants.
